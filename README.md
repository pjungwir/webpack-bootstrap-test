This project demonstrates how to use webpack to build one JS file and one CSS file,
including Bootstrap with working Glyphicons.
If you go to [index.html](index.html),
you should see a colored background, a thumbs up, and a cheerful alert message.

To try it out, say:

    npm install
    npm run watch
